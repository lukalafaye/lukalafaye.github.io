Fusion could make it possible to produce very large amounts of renewable energy in the upcoming years. Currently, only 10.4% of the energy consumed worldwide is renewable according to the BP Statistical Review, a British oil extraction, refining and sales company. This means that 90.6% of the energy we consume nowadays will have to be replaced in the near future. 

Some people believe that nuclear power will be more than enough to cover future energy needs. Nonetheless, it is not considered a renewable energy since it requires uranium, a heavy metal which exists in limited quantities on our planet. The Uranium Peak will occur in 2040 if we continue to mine it at the current rate. Therefore, in 2040, there will be no uranium left to mine.

So how can we produce energy without these resources? We can use renewable energy sources such as wind, water, fission, or even the sun. However, the ideal source would be fusion. It would not take much space, be inexhaustible, and would not release carbon or radioactive waste into the atmosphere.

In the future, energy will be produced thanks to our knowledge and not using exhaustible resources. We need to learn how to use renewable energy sources, and how to convert new energies quickly and efficiently in order to exploit them.

So how do we get energy from fusion?

The most stable nucleus in the periodic table is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table. Less stable atoms such as uranium are trying to get closer to iron. Uranium that is relatively large compared to iron wants to split, while smaller atoms want to fuse together. It is from this fusion that energy is obtained.

In other words, fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two light atoms fuse together to produce a heavier nucleus while releasing a certain amount of energy. This energy, called fusion energy, is mainly released in the form of heat.

Fusion is present in stars, as predicted by Edington. In the centre of stars, hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, which turns into carbon, which turns back into oxygen. However, this is a complicated process because it requires a high temperature, at least 150 million degrees Celsius.

The simplest fusion reaction to carry out is between two hydrogen isotopes, two types of hydrogen: deuterium, which is the heavy hydrogen obtained from mother liquor, and tritium, which is extremely heavy. These two atoms are charged and repel each other, but when they are brought close enough together, a strong interaction takes place and they fuse into helium 5, releasing a lot of energy as well as a proton.

To obtain tritium, lithium 6 is reacted with a neutron, and this produces helium and tritium. That explains why this type of fusion is renewable: you can reuse the neutron produced and carry out as many fusions as you want, while obviously maintaining a temperature of 150 million degrees. The heat actually excites the atoms in gaseous form, and causes them to collide, resulting in fusions.

If this type of fusion can be easily achieved, we will have enough deuterium atoms to produce energy for 30 million years.

The problem is that you have to keep the gas at 150 million degrees. It seems impossible, but it has already been done using a magnetic field and what is called a magnetic torus-shaped bottle at JET, Joint European Torus, the World's biggest fusion experiment, in 1997. Exactly 16 megawatts of energy was produced from the device. 1 megawatt is about 200 tons of uranium...

10 billion has been invested by the world's major powers to create a device that would enable this fusion, and by 2013, it is expected that half a gigawatt of energy will be produced in the form of heat. There is also the question of converting this energy into electricity so that it can be consumed.

In conclusion, the real question that needs to be asked is when will we be able to convert fusion energy into electricity. Scientists predict that we will be able to do it by 2040, and there will certainly be problems between now and then.
