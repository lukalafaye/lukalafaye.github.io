We are not aware of it but we are constantly creating our reality. What we see is not universal truth. It is not objective reality. What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain. Isaac Lidsky is a man that became blind at the age of 25 and he quickly realized that sight is an illusion.

Every second, our eyes can send our visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information. The rest of our body can only send an additional billion to our brain. That makes sight one third of our brain by volume, explaining why the illusion of sight is so compelling.

To create the experience of sight, our brain subconsciously references our conceptual understanding of the world, our memories, opinions, emotions, and mental attention. Therefore, what we see impacts how we feel, and reciprocally, the way we feel can change what we see. For example, a hill appears steeper if we have just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if we are wearing a heavy backpack. Sight is just one way we shape our reality. 

How can we live our life eyes wide open? 
Below is what Isaac Lidsky recommends doing. 

> Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail. See beyond your fears. Recognize your assumptions. Harness your internal strength. Silence your internal critic. Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success. Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference. Open your hearts to your bountiful blessings. 

In conclusion, we should let go of our excuses, assumptions and fears, and accept the awesome responsibility of being the creators of our own reality.
