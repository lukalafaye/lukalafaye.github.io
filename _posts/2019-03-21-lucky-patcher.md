# What is Lucky Patcher?

Lucky Patcher is an application designed to patch Android applications, create custom patches or create modified APKs without Root access. 
Lucky Patcher is a universal correction tool. It is intended to modify the applications to delete ads, delete the license check (automatically and manually), and manage permissions.

# How do I get it?

You will need to download an **APK** file (**Android Package Kit**) to install **Lucky Patcher**. An **APK** is the package file format used by the **Android OS** for distribution
and installation of **mobile apps**. In this case, the **APK** will be compressed in **ZIP** format to avoid **malware warning** in browsers.

## 1. Enable Unknown Sources

Use two fingers to swipe down from the top of the screen, then tap the "**Settings**" **gear icon** in the top-right corner of the resulting **drop-down menu**.
Scroll down and tap **Security**, then tick the box next to **Unknow Sources**.

## 2. Head over to Lucky Patcher's official website

Click this link to open **Lucky Patcher**'s **official website**:
[www.luckypatchers.com/download](https://www.luckypatchers.com/download/)

## 3. Install the ZIP

Tap the **blue button** in **Latest Version** section "DOWNLOAD LUCKY PATCHER x.x.x APK". If you see any **warning** in your browser, just click on "Details" and "Visit this unsafe site". 
The download will start, tap **OK** when prompted. 

## 4. Extract the ZIP and install the APK

You will need **ES File Explorer File Managaer** to extract the downloaded **ZIP** file. You can download the **app** in the **playstore** with this link:
[play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop)

**Open** the **ZIP** file with ES File Explorer and tap on it to extract it. You'll find the Lucky Patcher APK. Click on it, do not tap **OK** if you see a warning. Instead, tap **details**
and just click **Install anyway**. Install the APK and you'll find the app on your **home screen**.

Note that sometimes, Google Play Store may show you a warning to uninstall Lucky Patcher app. 
Disable "Play Protect" on Play Store to hide this warning. You can also click on "Keep Anyway (unsafe)" button to bypass the warning.

## 5. Use Lucky Patcher

1. Open **Lucky Patcher** and find an app you want to modify. 
2. Tap on the app and select **open menu of patches**
3. Select **create modified apk**
4. Select **APK with multiple patches**
5. Tap all patches you want (In app and LVL emulation, APK without Google ads, APK without licence verification)
6. Now proceed to create the app with desired options and "Please Wait" so it can build it
7. When the new APK is created, tap **Go to the file** and **Uninstall and Install** (confirm when prompted)
8. Open the app and enjoy!

Note that you can patch an app only once, if you want to remove more unwanted features of the app, you'll have to patch the modified APK of the app.
