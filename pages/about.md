</script>you have approached a site of knowledge fashioned in the manner of modern blogs. As you shall see upon entry to this site, if you so choose, there is quite a bit of information to indulge in.

Though this knowledge comes to you free of charge, it does require of you an open mind and some self-doing. You will find here handy lore about Science, Technology, Web, Programming and Ethical Hacking.

Please note that you will not find any advertisements whatsoever on this site: no banners to click on, no sponsors to promote, nothing. We don't need your money : our only hope is that you will, one beautiful day, contribute yourself to the world's vast wealth of knowledge.
